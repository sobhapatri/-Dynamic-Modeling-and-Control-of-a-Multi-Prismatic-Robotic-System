# 🤖 Dynamic Modeling and Control of a Multi-Prismatic Robotic System

This project explores the dynamic modeling and control strategies of a robotic arm with multiple prismatic joints. It includes simulation, analytical derivation of dynamics, indirect force control, and a Graphical User Interface (GUI) to visualize and interact with the system in real-time.
